# Python More Data Structures

This repository contains Python code examples related to more advanced data structures and operations. The focus is on exploring additional data structures beyond the basics, such as sets, dictionaries, and comprehensions.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find Python scripts that demonstrate the use of more advanced data structures and various operations that can be performed on them. The examples cover sets, dictionaries, and other related topics.

## Files and Descriptions

- **`sets_example.py`**: Illustrates the use of sets in Python.
- **`dictionaries_example.py`**: Demonstrates operations and methods related to dictionaries.
- **`comprehensions_example.py`**: Shows how to use comprehensions for concise and readable code.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the provided Python scripts to understand how these advanced data structures work. Each script is self-contained and includes comments for clarity. You can run the scripts individually to see the output and modify them according to your needs.

```bash
python sets_example.py
