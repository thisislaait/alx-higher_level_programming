# Python Learning Series

Welcome to the Python Learning Series! In this series, I will delve into the world of Python, an easy-to-learn and powerful programming language. Python's efficiency, high-level data structures, and straightforward approach to object-oriented programming make it ideal for scripting and rapid application development across various domains and platforms.

## Prerequisites

### Python Scripts

- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpretation/Compilation:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- **File Conventions:**
  - All files should end with a new line.
  - The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **README.md:**
  - A README.md file at the root of the repository with a description is mandatory.
- **Coding Style:**
  - Code should adhere to PEP8 standards using pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- **Execution:**
  - All files must be executable.
- **Length:**
  - File length will be tested using `wc`.

### Shell Scripts

- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Testing:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **File Conventions:**
  - All scripts should be exactly two lines long (`wc -l file` should print 2).
  - All files should end with a new line.
  - The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`.
- **Execution:**
  - All files must be executable.

### C Scripts

- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Compilation:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- **File Conventions:**
  - All files should end with a new line.
  - Code should follow the Betty style and will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
  - No global variables allowed.
  - No more than 5 functions per file.
  - Prototypes of functions should be included in a header file named lists.h.
  - Header files should be include guarded.
- **Execution:**
  - All files must be executable.

## Python Availability

The Python interpreter and its extensive standard library are available freely in source or binary form for all major platforms from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/). The site also provides distributions and pointers to many free third-party Python modules, programs, tools, and additional documentation.

Python is easily extendable with new functions and data types implemented in C, C++, or other languages callable from C, making it suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.
