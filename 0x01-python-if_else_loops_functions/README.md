## Task Descriptions

### Task 0: Positive anything is better than negative nothing
**Objective:** This program assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. The source code needs completion to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.


### Task 1: The last digit
**Objective:** This program assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. The source code needs completion to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.


### Task 2: I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
**Objective:** Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.


### Task 3: When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
**Objective:** Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. Exclude the letters 'q' and 'e'.


### Task 4: Hexadecimal printing
**Objective:** Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.


### Task 5: 00...99
**Objective:** Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.


### Task 6: Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
**Objective:** Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.


### Task 7: islower
**Objective:** Write a function that checks for a lowercase character.


### Task 8: To be able to work with an object, you have to type it first
**Objective:** Write a function that prints the alphabet in uppercase."


### Task 9: There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
**Objective:** Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.


### Task 10: a+b
**Objective:** Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.


### Task 11: a ^ b
**Objective:** Write a function that computes a to the power of b and returns the value.


### Task 12: Fizz Buzz
**Objective:** Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space. For multiples of three, print "Fizz"; for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".


### Task 13: Insert in sorted linked list
**Objective:** Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

### Task 14: Smile in the mirror
**Objective:** Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase), not followed by a new line.

### Task 15: Remove at position
**Objective:** Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the "C array index").

### Task 16: ByteCode -> Python #2
**Objective:** Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the given Python bytecode.
